# WatchNext Project Rules

## Deployment Rules
- NEVER push to GitHub or trigger deployments without explicit user approval
- User has a free Netlify account with limited build minutes
- Always ask before running `git push` or any deployment commands
- Inform user when changes are ready to deploy, but wait for confirmation

## Cost Management
- Claude API costs are a concern - always optimize for minimal token usage
- Recommendations are cached for 24 hours to reduce API calls
- Only send top 40 pre-filtered candidates to Claude API
- Limit watch history and watchlist context sent to Claude

## Development Workflow
- Test changes locally first before deploying
- User will manually trigger Netlify deployments when ready
